<h3 style="color: white; font-family:initial;">A coffeehouse, coffee shop, or café is an establishment that primarily serves coffee of various types, notably espresso, latte, and cappuccino. Some coffeehouses may serve cold drinks, such as iced coffee and iced tea, as well as other non-caffeinated beverages. In continental Europe, cafés serve alcoholic drinks.</h3><br><br><br>
<h3 style="color: white; font-family:initial;">The interior of this café is rather cosy and comfortable. Inside the café one can observe several small wooden tables without table-cloths, wooden chairs and nice soft sofas. There are stands with sugar, salt and paper napkins on the tables. Near the entrance, there is a large mirror, therefore the visitors have an opportunity to look at themselves.
  Along the walls are wooden cases with some pictures and photos.You can always hear unostentatious and melodic music there.</h3><br>
